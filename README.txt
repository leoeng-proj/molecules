This is an effort to learn OpenGL inspired by Sebastian Lague's "Simulating Fluids" video.

I am following a general guideline I made to simplify the learning process:
Draw a triangle
Draw a circle
Make a single circle move down (gravity)
Add window controls: pause, play, change in number of circles
Draw multiple circles
Make multiple circles move down (gravity)
Involve collisions. Make each circle color correspond to it's velocity
